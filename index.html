            <h1>Welcome.</h1>

            <p> This is a work in progress that I hope will translate into a nice vanity page. During the interm there won't be much to show but as I learn more skills I'll be sure to add more content. 
            <br>
        Some of the things I hope to include are as follows;
                <ul>
                    <li>A DnD character generator.<li>
                    <li>An application to compute various rates of return for investments.</li>
                    <li>A html parser that takes a single html and generates several files from it</il>
                </ul>
            <br>
            I don't really know how to do any of these and feedback critiques are strongly welcomed.   
            </p>
